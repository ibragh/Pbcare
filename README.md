<h2> Pregnancy and Baby Care Application </h2>
Technology is an important aspect of our life today, especially for civilized society.  It is possible now for consumers to use electronic devices to access their medical information, monitor their vital signs, take tests at home and carry out a wide range of tasks.<b> Therefore </b>, we would like to help in providing an easy way for pregnant woman to do a regular checkup for her baby including the vaccination and others features. In order to provide these features, we decided to create a mobile application that allows mothers to make sure that their health states during pregnancy period are fine. It will be based on the information of the normal pregnancy  that every woman should go through. These information include aspects of the fetus development every week, and a general health education about every stage of pregnancy. The application contains also calculation of the due date, reminders of the important events, such as vaccination for both child and its mother in a particular time that will be defined by the mother or directly through the application itself. Calculation of vaccination appointment is based on birthday of the child. The application also allow a mother to follow-up the natural status from the birth to 1-2 years, which will be helpful in observing the growth of the baby. In addition, the application can alarm the mother if her child came out of bedroom.
